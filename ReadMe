
Penetration Testing using DDOS

 Be careful witht the target that you choose here. In this case, I chose the IP-address of my router at home(fake one; target). You can also choose your home server, your printer or maybe even your own website. If you donâ€™t know your IP-address, you can use your command line and ping the domain to get it. As a fake IP-address I chose a random but still valid address. Last but not least, I decided to attack the port 80, which is HTTP. If you want to shut down a specific service, you need to know which port it is operating at. Check out this link, for a detailed list. The next thing we need to do is to implement the actual attacking function.
